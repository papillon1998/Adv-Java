In Java, the equals() method and the == operator are used to compare objects, but they work in different ways:

The == operator compares the references of two objects. 
It checks to see if the two operands point to the exact same object in memory. 
If they do, it returns true; if they don't, it returns false.

The equals() method is used for comparing the state of two objects. 
The default implementation of equals() in the Object class behaves exactly like the == operator; 
it returns true if the two references point to the same object. 
However, equals() can be overridden in a class to check if two objects have the same state (i.e., their properties have the same values), rather than checking if they point to the same memory location.
